# alexa-home-assistant-proxy-js

Just some PoC to play around with Node.js 20 and AWS SAM. Functionality is ported from [lambda_function.py by matt2005](https://gist.github.com/matt2005/744b5ef548cc13d88d0569eea65f5e5b).

The app can be deployed on AWS Lambda to serve as a proxy between Home Assistant and a custom Alexa Smart Home Skill.

For a detailed guide, check out the [Home Assistant documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa.smart_home/).
